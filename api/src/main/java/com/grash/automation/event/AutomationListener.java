/**
 * Hands a committed entity change to the rule engine.

 * <p>The three properties that make this a listener rather than a call in a service are the same
 * ones spelled out in {@code RequestTriageListener}, which this copies on purpose:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>After commit.</b> The publisher runs inside a transaction, so at the moment it fires
 *       the change is not visible outside it. A rule that loads the entity on another thread
 *       would find the old state, or nothing — intermittently, depending on timing.</li>
 *   <li><b>Off the caller thread</b>, and on {@link AutomationAsyncConfig#EXECUTOR} rather than
 *       the shared pool, so a rule never queues behind a CSV export.</li>
 *   <li><b>Failure is invisible.</b> Whatever happens here, the change that triggered it has
 *       already been committed and must stay committed. The old engine ran inline in the same
 *       transaction, so a failing action took the original operation down with it.</li>
 * </ul>
