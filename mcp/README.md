# cmms4fm-mcp

An MCP server over the CMMS REST API. Design and reasoning: [`docs/mcp-server-konzept.md`](../docs/mcp-server-konzept.md).

It is a **stateless proxy**. It holds no database, no session, no cache, and above all no
identity: every call carries the caller's own `x-api-key` to `/api`, where `ApiKeyAuthFilter`
resolves it to a user and applies that user's role, permissions and company. The server adds
no privilege and cannot exceed the key it was handed. Compromise it and you gain exactly
what that key already allowed.

## What it does, in one paragraph

At boot it fetches the OpenAPI document from the running CMMS and derives one tool per
endpoint — 348 of them from the current document. A **profile** decides which of those a
client actually sees, because a model handed 348 tools chooses badly. About thirty core
endpoints carry hand-written names and descriptions (`search_assets`, `get_asset`,
`search_work_orders`); the rest get names and descriptions derived from the document. A
discovery tool, `list_capabilities`, searches the whole surface including the hidden part, so
an agent can report "this exists but is not enabled here" instead of concluding the CMMS
cannot do it.

## Before it works at all

`SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM=true` must be set on the `api` service. Upstream gates the entire
`x-api-key` path behind the `API_ACCESS` entitlement *and* the plan feature, both of which
that flag opens (CLAUDE.md, "Self-hosting premium unlock"). Without it every tool call answers
`403 {"message":"Access denied"}` and nothing anywhere says why — which is why this server
attaches that hint to any 403 whose message is exactly `Access denied`.

To check without credentials, ask the API itself — `/license/state` is `permitAll`:

```bash
curl -s https://<domain>/api/license/state | grep -o 'API_ACCESS'
```

An answer means the gate is open. On the deployed instance it already is.

Then create an API key in the CMMS under **Settings → Integrations → API Keys**, for a user
whose permissions are the ones this client should have. That user is the real security
boundary; the profile below is only about what the model can see.

## Running it

```bash
npm ci
npm test          # compiles with strict tsc, then runs the suite
npm run build && npm start
```

Local run against the deployed instance, read-only, over stdio — the shape a desktop client
uses:

```bash
CMMS_BASE_URL=https://cmms.example.com/api \
CMMS_API_KEY=<your key> \
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
PROFILE=core-readonly \
node dist/src/index.js
```

For a client entry (Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector), point `command` at `node` and `args` at
`dist/src/index.js`, and put the variables above in that client's `env` block.

In the deployed stack the server runs as the `mcp` service behind nginx at `/mcp`, so a remote
client connects to `https://<domain>/mcp` over Streamable HTTP and sends its key with the
request.

### How a client sends the key

Either header works, and they mean the same thing — whichever the client can actually produce:

```
x-api-key: <key>
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

The bearer form is not a second credential scheme and not OAuth: the token is forwarded to the
CMMS as `x-api-key` either way, so it grants nothing extra. It is accepted because clients
overwhelmingly offer a bearer field and sometimes little else — **n8n's MCP Client node**
presents "Bearer Auth" as the ready-made option, and its generic "Header Auth" credential is
where a custom `x-api-key` would live.

**The failure this produces is worth recognising, because it does not look like an auth
problem.** With no key the connection succeeds, `tools/list` returns the full tool set, and
`list_capabilities` answers normally — that one tool needs no key, because it only reads the
catalogue the server already holds. Every *other* tool answers
`{"kind": "unauthenticated", ...}`. So it reads as "the server works but most tools are
broken" when in fact nothing was authenticated at all.

## Driving it from n8n

n8n's **MCP Client** node is the first client this server ran against, so its settings are
worth writing down.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server Transport | HTTP Streamable |
| MCP Endpoint URL | `https://<domain>/mcp` |
| Authentication | Bearer Auth — or Header Auth with the name `x-api-key`; both work |
| Credential | the API key from Settings → Integrations → API Keys |

The node's **Manual** input mode builds an argument skeleton from the tool's JSON Schema. For
a search tool that skeleton is not a usable call — it fills every optional field with a
placeholder. Replace it with only what you need:

```json
{ "pageSize": 25, "sortField": "id", "direction": "DESC" }
```

```json
{ "filterFields": [
    { "field": "status", "operation": "in", "values": ["OPEN"], "enumName": "STATUS" }
  ],
  "pageSize": 25 }
```

`{}` is a valid body — it returns the first page with the server's defaults.

`enumName` is not decoration: status and priority are stored as enum **ordinals**, so without
it the filter compares text against a number, matches nothing, and reports no error. Only
`PRIORITY`, `STATUS` and `JS_DATE` are supported there (`WrapperSpecification.getRealValue`).

### When something does not work

Every failure comes back as JSON with a `kind`, so read that first rather than the prose.

| Symptom | What it means |
|---|---|
| Connection fine, `tools/list` full, but **only `list_capabilities` works** | No key is arriving. That one tool needs none — it only reads the catalogue the server already holds. Check the credential is actually attached to the node. |
| `"kind": "unauthenticated"`, no `status` | The key never reached the server. Same cause as above. |
| `"kind": "unauthenticated"`, `"status": 401` | The key reached the CMMS and was rejected: wrong, revoked, or from another instance. |
| `"kind": "forbidden"`, `"status": 403`, message mentions `SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM` | The API-key path is gated. Check `/api/license/state` for `API_ACCESS`. |
| `"kind": "forbidden"`, `"status": 403`, ordinary message | The key is valid; its **user** lacks the permission. Fix it in the CMMS, not here. |
| `"kind": "business_failure"`, `"status": 500` | The CMMS refused on business grounds and the message is the reason — e.g. `Page size must not be less than one` from a `pageSize: 0` placeholder. Retrying changes nothing. |
| `"kind": "temporarily_unavailable"` | The CMMS is not ready. It needs tens of seconds after a restart. |
| `"the tool exists but is not enabled in this deployment"` | The profile hides it. `list_capabilities` says what else exists; widening is `MCP_PROFILE` in Coolify. |
| The whole domain answers `no available server` | Not this service — the stack is mid-deploy. Wait it out. |
| **A write reports success and nothing changed in the CMMS** | It very likely changed a *different* record. The generated tools inherit the API's naming, and where that misleads, so do they — a stock booking landed on `PATCH /part-quantities/{id}`, which is a work order line, not inventory. Read the record back after any write through a tool that has no written description, and treat the mismatch as a candidate for the curated table. |

Nothing here is guesswork: each row was produced at least once while getting the first client
working.

## Configuration

Every setting, with its default, is in [`.env.example`](.env.example). The four that decide
how the server behaves:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PROFILE` | Which tools are visible. `readonly` (default), `core`, `core-readonly`, `assets`, `workorders`, `full` |
| `READ_ONLY` | Hides every writing tool whatever the profile says — the last word, it outranks `TOOLS_ALLOW` |
| `AUTH_MODE` | `passthrough` (each client brings its own key) or `service` (the server holds one) |
| `RATE_LIMIT` | Tool calls per minute per key. `0` disables it |

`TOOLS_ALLOW` and `TOOLS_DENY` take comma-separated globs (`get_*`, `*_assets_*`) on top of
the profile; a deny always wins.

### Choosing a profile

**The profile is a property of the deployment, not of the client.** One `MCP_PROFILE` applies
to everyone connecting to this service, so two clients with different needs cannot currently
be given different tool sets from one deployment — run a second service with its own profile,
or see [`docs/mcp-server-konzept.md`](../docs/mcp-server-konzept.md) §13, which records the
options and is deliberately still open.

And whatever the profile, it grants nothing: a client seeing `full` with a read-only key gets a
403 from the CMMS on every write. The profile decides what a model *sees* — 29 tools are chosen
between well, 349 are not — while the key's user decides what may *happen*.


- **A client that processes input nobody vouched for** — an uploaded PDF, an incoming email:
  `PROFILE=core-readonly` **and** a key belonging to a read-only user. Two independent locks,
  because prompt injection through a document has to fail even if one of them is wrong. This
  is the rule [`ki-meldungs-triage.md`](../docs/ki-meldungs-triage.md) sets and the concept
  adopts: untrusted input must not be able to write, and writing stays something a person
  triggers in the frontend.
- **An assistant for a person doing maintenance work**: `PROFILE=core` or `workorders`, with a
  key belonging to that person, so the CMMS's own audit trail records who did it.
- **`PROFILE=full`** exists for exploration. It is 348 tools; expect worse tool selection, not
  better coverage.

## What it deliberately does not do

- **No business logic.** A tool call is "call this endpoint cleanly" and nothing else. No
  validation, no computation, no multi-step composition. The CMMS decides.
- **No LLM.** The server never calls a model and never sends anything outward. Whether FM
  data may cross a boundary is the client's decision and stays visible as such.
- **No second permission system.** No roles of its own, no tenant logic. Profiles govern
  *visibility*; permission is the CMMS's answer alone.

## Design decisions the code makes, and why

These are the places where the implementation had to choose, and each cost something to find
out. They are documented at the top of the file that owns them.

**Tool names come from method plus path, never from `operationId`**
([`src/tools/naming.ts`](src/tools/naming.ts)). springdoc names operations after the Java
method and disambiguates collisions with a scan-order counter, so this document calls
`POST /assets/search` → `search_15` and `PATCH /assets/{id}` → `patch_40`. That is unusable
for a model *and* unstable: adding one controller upstream renumbers unrelated tools and
silently breaks every client allowlist. `post_assets_search` changes only when the endpoint
does.

**The read/write split cannot come from the HTTP method**
([`src/tools/describe.ts`](src/tools/describe.ts)). Every list endpoint in this API is a
**POST** carrying a filter body, and so is every analytics query. Classify those as writing
and `PROFILE=readonly` can no longer find anything, which makes the read-only deployment
useless rather than safe. The read-only POST shapes are therefore an explicit list; anything
not on it counts as writing.

**Curation is mandatory, not polish** ([`src/tools/curated.ts`](src/tools/curated.ts)). The
document describes **6** of its 373 operations — all of them webhook endpoints plus one
histogram. The other 367 arrive with no summary and no description, so generated tools would
tell a model the HTTP method and nothing more.

**The document is loaded at runtime, not generated into code**
([`src/openapi/loader.ts`](src/openapi/loader.ts)). This is what makes "a new endpoint
upstream becomes a tool" true without a code-generation step that can drift, and it is why
readiness means "the document is loaded". `SPEC_REFRESH_MINUTES` re-reads it without a
redeploy. It also means the tool set depends on a running CMMS — hence `SPEC_FILE` as a
fallback.

**The document lives at the group URL.** `/v3/api-docs` answers **404** on this API:
`springdoc.enable-default-api-docs` is false in `application.yml`, so only the named group
`/v3/api-docs/atlas-cmms` serves it. This looks exactly like the API being down.

**Input schemas are inlined with two guards** ([`src/openapi/schema.ts`](src/openapi/schema.ts)).
OpenAPI 3.1 schemas already *are* JSON Schema, so no dialect translation is needed — but
entity DTOs reference each other, and `PreventiveMaintenancePostDTO` inlines to about 130 KB.
Cycles become untyped objects; anything past `MAX_SCHEMA_CHARS` is pruned to its top level,
with the full definition still readable through `cmms://schema/{name}`.

**Defaults the document dropped are put back** ([`src/openapi/overlays.ts`](src/openapi/overlays.ts)).
`SearchCriteria` — the body of every search tool — has real defaults in Java (`pageSize = 10`,
`pageNum = 0`, `sortField = "id"`, `filterFields = []`) and springdoc emits none of them, nor
the fact that every field is optional. A client that dutifully fills each field it sees
therefore invents values: n8n's manual input mode produces `"field": "string"` and
`pageSize: 0`, and the CMMS answers `500 "Page size must not be less than one"` — for a call
that would have succeeded with those fields left out. The overlay table transcribes the
defaults and bounds off the Java class; it changes nothing about the request, only what the
tool advertises. Keep it small and keep every entry traceable to a line of Java.

**Failures are translated, not forwarded** ([`src/cmms/errors.ts`](src/cmms/errors.ts)). Each
result carries a `kind`, a `retryable` verdict and an `advice` line, because an agent that
sees only "something went wrong" retries a 403 forever and gives up on a 503. A 500 with a
message is a business refusal in this codebase (usage limits are thrown as bare
`RuntimeException`s), so its text survives and it is marked not retryable.

**Some endpoints are never offered** ([`src/tools/describe.ts`](src/tools/describe.ts)):
`/auth/**`, `/subscriptions/**`, `/subscription-plans*`, `/notifications/push-token`. Not a
permission decision — they stay reachable over REST — but an agent has no business issuing
credentials, ending sessions or changing billing, and offering them only creates a path for an
injected instruction to reach them. File-upload endpoints are excluded too, because binary
content cannot travel in a JSON tool call; `list_capabilities` reports the reason rather than
letting them vanish.

**The low-level SDK `Server`, not `McpServer`** ([`src/server.ts`](src/server.ts)).
`registerTool` wants Zod schemas; ours are JSON Schema derived at runtime. Converting to Zod
and back would be a lossy round trip to produce what we already have.

**nginx resolves the service lazily** ([`docker/nginx/nginx.conf`](../docker/nginx/nginx.conf)).
An `upstream` block is resolved once at startup and nginx refuses to start with "host not
found in upstream" — a stopped `mcp` service would black out the whole domain. A variable in
`proxy_pass` defers the lookup, so `/mcp` answers 502 and everything else keeps serving.

## Liveness and readiness are different questions

| Endpoint | Answers | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /livez` | `200` as soon as the process is listening | the container healthcheck |
| `GET /healthz` (`/readyz`) | `200` once tools can be served; `503` otherwise, saying which of the two reasons it is | a human, a monitor |

`/healthz` distinguishes the two states that look alike and are not:

```jsonc
{ "status": "starting", "waitingFor": "the OpenAPI document from the CMMS",
  "attempts": 3, "waitingSeconds": 42, "lastError": "fetch failed" }   // waiting fixes this

{ "status": "misconfigured", "problem": "Unknown PROFILE \"FULL\". Available: …",
  "fix": "Correct the environment of this service and redeploy." }     // waiting never will
```

Read that endpoint first whenever a client reports no tools. It once claimed to be waiting on
the CMMS for five minutes while the real problem was `MCP_PROFILE=FULL` being matched case
sensitively — the document had loaded on the first try. Profile names are now matched by word,
and a configuration error stops the retrying and says so.

Conflating the two once took the service down. The server used to load the document *before*
listening, gave up after 150 seconds and exited; Coolify restarted it into the same race and
the stack ended at `Restart limit reached`. The race could not be won: `mcp` waits on the api
with `service_started`, which is satisfied the moment the api *container* starts, while the api
itself needs upwards of 150 seconds for Liquibase, Hibernate and Quartz. Both clocks start
together on a cold machine. Every deploy against an already-running api worked, which is
exactly why it survived every test until the server was restarted.

It now listens first and learns second: the document is fetched in the background, retried
with a backoff that stops growing at a minute, and never given up on. While it waits,
`tools/list` is empty and a tool call answers `temporarily_unavailable` with `retryable: true`
rather than pretending. A slow neighbour is a state to report, not a reason to die.

The container healthcheck therefore probes `/livez`: the only thing a restart could ever fix is
a process that is not running.

## Audit

One line per tool call on **stderr** (stdout is the protocol on stdio): time, tool, endpoint,
HTTP status, failure kind, duration, and a 12-character hash of the key. Never the key,
never the arguments, never the response. That answers "who called what and how did it end",
which is the question an audit is for, without turning the log into a copy of the data.

## Tests

`npm test` compiles with `strict` and runs the suite; both the image build and CI run the
same thing. Most assertions run against
[`test/fixtures/api-docs.json`](test/fixtures/api-docs.json) — the real document, saved
verbatim — because the things that break here are properties of the real document (generated
`operationId`s, POST-based search, absent descriptions) that no hand-written stub would
reproduce. [`test/e2e.test.ts`](test/e2e.test.ts) drives an MCP client against the server
against a stand-in CMMS and checks the parts unit tests cannot: that the key survives the
trip, that a 403 comes back structured, that a hidden tool stays uncallable, that the rate
limit bites, and that the audit line contains neither the key nor the data.

Refreshing the fixture after an upstream sync that changed the API:

```bash
curl -s https://<domain>/api/v3/api-docs/atlas-cmms > mcp/test/fixtures/api-docs.json
npm test    # a changed count or a renamed endpoint fails here, which is the point
```
