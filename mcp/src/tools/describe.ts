/**
 * Read/write classification and descriptions for operations the curated layer does not
 * cover.
 *
 * **Why classification cannot come from the HTTP method alone.** The concept derives
 * `readOnlyHint` from the method (GET reads, DELETE/PUT write), which is the right default
 * and wrong for this API in one decisive place: every list endpoint is a **POST** carrying
 * a `SearchCriteria` body — `POST /assets/search`, `POST /work-orders/search` — and so is
 * every analytics query. Classify those as writing and `PROFILE=readonly` loses the ability
 * to find anything, which makes the read-only deployment useless rather than safe.
 *
 * So the rule is: GET reads; POST reads when it is one of the query shapes below; anything
 * else writes. The list is explicit rather than heuristic, so an upstream endpoint that
 * introduces a new query shape is classified as writing until someone looks at it — the
 * error that costs a hidden tool, not the one that exposes a write.

 * Endpoints that are never offered as a tool, in any profile.

 * This is not a second permission system (konzept non-goal): every one of these stays

 * is tool-surface hygiene — an agent has no business issuing credentials, ending its own
 * session, changing what the organisation pays, or registering a push device, and offering
 * those as tools only adds a way for an injected instruction to reach them.
