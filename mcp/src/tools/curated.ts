/**
 * Layer two of the tool model (konzept §4.3): hand-written names and descriptions for the
 * endpoints an agent actually reaches for.
 *
 * Curation is not cosmetic here. The document describes **6 of its 373 operations** — the
 * other 367 arrive with no summary and no description at all — so a purely generated tool
 * set tells a model the HTTP method and nothing else. The entries below are the difference
 * between "there is a tool called post_assets_search" and "this is how you find an asset".
 *
 * A curated name *replaces* the generated one rather than adding a second tool, so there is
 * exactly one way to call each endpoint. Everything not listed keeps its generated name and
 * a synthesised description (tools/describe.ts).
 *
 * These strings say what an endpoint is and how to address it. They deliberately do not
 * encode business rules — that is the CMMS's job (konzept §1, non-goal "no business logic").
