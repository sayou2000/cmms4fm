 * Profiles decide what a client *sees*, not what it is *allowed* to do (konzept §4.3/E4).
 * The permission answer comes from the CMMS and from the user the API key belongs to; a
 * profile only keeps the visible tool set small enough for a model to choose well from.
 *
 * Consequence worth stating: widening a profile grants nothing. A `full` profile on a
 * read-only key still cannot write — the CMMS answers 403. Narrowing a profile, on the
 * other hand, does not protect a powerful key either; that is what the key's user is for.
