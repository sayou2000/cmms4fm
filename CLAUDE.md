# CLAUDE.md

Working notes for this repository. Read before changing build, deployment or auth code.

Design documentation for individual subsystems lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md):
[`docs/reporting.md`](docs/reporting.md) for the `rpt_*` reporting views, saved list views and
filtered exports — read it before changing anything under `controller/analytics/`, the `rpt_*`
views, or the CSV export; [`docs/terminology-de.md`](docs/terminology-de.md) for the partly
finished German wording migration, before editing `de.ts`; [`docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT_REMEDIATION.md`](docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT_REMEDIATION.md) for the frontend dependency backlog — read it before any dependency upgrade, it records how deep each package sits and which one blocks React 18;
[`docs/custom-field-categories.md`](docs/custom-field-categories.md) for custom fields bound to
asset categories — read it before touching `CustomFieldValueService`, which deliberately
*discards* a value for the wrong category instead of refusing the request, and before deciding
anything about `mobile/`;
[`docs/ki-meldungs-triage.md`](docs/ki-meldungs-triage.md) for the asset suggestion on incoming
requests — read it before touching anything under `service/triage/`, and before assuming the
workflow engine can carry out what a matcher decided, because it cannot;
[`docs/workflow-engine-konzept.md`](docs/workflow-engine-konzept.md) for the rule automation —
read it before touching `Workflow*` or publishing a domain event from a service, because it
records why an async listener cannot persist a `CompanyAudit` entity without setting the company
by hand, why a field diff in `AssetService.update` misses every status change, and why the rule
editor asks the server what exists instead of keeping its own lists;
[`docs/automation-engine.md`](docs/automation-engine.md) is its working companion — read it
before touching `automation/capture/**` or adding a trigger, because it records that field
changes are captured from Hibernate's own dirty-property set rather than from per-service publish
points, that a rule's own writes are therefore announced back to it and only `CascadeContext`
keeps that from looping, and that one transaction may announce at most
`AUTOMATION_MAX_CHANGES_PER_TRANSACTION` changed rows before the rest is dropped with a warning;
[`docs/mcp-server-konzept.md`](docs/mcp-server-konzept.md) plus [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md)
for the MCP server — read them before touching `mcp/`, the `/mcp` nginx route or anything about
`x-api-key`, because they record why tool names cannot come from `operationId`, why read/write
cannot be derived from the HTTP method in this API, and that the whole thing is dead without
`SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM=true`.

## What this is

A fork of **Atlas CMMS** (upstream: `Grashjs/cmms`, renamed from `atlas-cmms`), a maintenance management
system, adapted for self-hosting in an FM-IT consulting context.

**This is a private learning instance, not a product and not a customer deployment.** It
exists to work out which FM functions, features and processes the market actually needs, by
using them rather than by speculating about them. That purpose decides most trade-offs here:
being current enough that new capability works matters, production hardening does not.

Licensed **AGPL-3.0**: serving a modified version over a network obliges us to offer the
corresponding source, including our changes. This repository being public satisfies that, and
it has to stay public for as long as the instance is reachable. **This repository is public.
Never commit hostnames, IP addresses, database credentials, container UUIDs or customer names.**

**Contributing changes back upstream is deliberately not the plan.** Several changes here would
be good candidates — the Vite migration, the type-check wiring, a locale-independent fix for
the template tests — and an earlier version of this file said improvements were meant to go
back out. They are not. The owner is a product manager, not a developer, and upstreaming means
taking on review cycles and a maintainer relationship for a side project. The cost of that is
carrying the divergence instead, which is what the Upstream section below is for. Do not
propose upstream PRs as a next step; keep improvements local and keep the divergence table
accurate, which is the cheaper half of the same bargain.

## Stack

| Part | Tech | Port | Image |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api/` | Spring Boot 3.2.3, Java 17, Liquibase, Quartz, Envers | 8080 | `cmms4fm-api` |
| `frontend/` | React 17 + Vite, served by nginx | 3000 | `cmms4fm-frontend` |
| `docker/nginx/` | Single-domain reverse proxy | 80 | `cmms4fm-nginx` |
| `mcp/` | MCP server (TypeScript, Node 22) over the REST API | 8081 | `cmms4fm-mcp` |
| — | PostgreSQL 16 | 5432 | upstream |
| — | MinIO (attachments) | 9000 | upstream |
| `mobile/` | React Native app (Expo 53 / RN 0.79) | — | not built here, **unmodified upstream** |

The nginx service is the **only** publicly reachable one. It routes `/` → frontend,
`/api/` → api, `/storage/` → minio, `/mcp` → mcp. Single domain, so no CORS and one certificate.

## Commands

```bash
# API tests (~3 min in CI)
cd api && mvn -B test -DargLine="--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED"

# API package
cd api && mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build   # vite build, ~1 min
cd frontend && npm run lint
cd frontend && npm start                                       # vite dev server on 3000

# MCP server (compiles with strict tsc, then runs the suite; ~2 s)
cd mcp && npm ci && npm test
```

**`mvn compile` is not a check.** Without `clean` the compiler plugin's incremental pass can
leave an edited file untranslated and still exit 0 — a type error that fails CI looks green
locally. The image build runs `mvn clean package -DskipTests`; use that, or nothing.

**The template tests fail locally on a machine whose system locale is not English, and that
is the machine's fault, not the code's.** `AbstractTemplateTest` renders with
`Locale.ENGLISH`, but there is no `mailMessages_en.properties` — only the base bundle. Java's
`ResourceBundle` fills that gap by falling back to the *JVM default locale* before it falls
back to the base bundle, so on a German workstation every one of the eighteen tests in
`MainLayoutConsumerTemplatesTest`, `MainLayoutTemplateTest` and `WorkOrderReportTemplateTest`
renders German text and fails its first `assertTrue(html.contains(...))`. CI runs in English
and is green. They all fail identically and at the first assertion, which makes them look like
one broken shared fragment — they are not. Run them with `-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US`
to see them pass, or ignore exactly those eighteen. Making them locale-independent would mean
`setFallbackToSystemLocale(false)` on the message source, which is upstream's file and a good
candidate to contribute back.

**Local Maven tests are usable again.** The old note that the suite cannot run above JDK 22
(Byte Buddy refusing newer class files) no longer holds — after the 2026-08-26 upstream sync
the full suite runs on JDK 25. Only the five `*IntegrationTest` classes still error, and only
because Testcontainers needs a running Docker.

**The frontend build type-checks again, and `mvn compile`'s lesson applies here too.**
`npm run build` is `tsc --noEmit && vite build`: Vite itself never looks at types — esbuild
strips them — so the compiler runs in front of it and a type error stops the build before the
bundler starts. `npm run typecheck` runs the same check alone.

This was broken for a long time and worth knowing about, because the failure mode was silent.
TypeScript 4.7.3 could not *parse* the i18next type definitions and died with 88 syntax errors
inside `node_modules` before reaching `src/` — so an empty error list for `src/` meant the
check had not run, not that it passed. TypeScript 5.9.3 reads them fine. Turning the check
back on surfaced 34 real errors that had accumulated behind it; they are fixed, and the wiring
was verified by planting a type error and confirming the build fails with exit 2 without Vite
running.

## Deployment

**Images are built in CI and pulled by Coolify. Never build on the deployment server** —
the frontend build is the memory-hungry step and will freeze a shared host.

```
push to main → .github/workflows/deploy.yml
             → builds api, frontend, nginx, mcp in parallel (GHA cache per image)
             → pushes ghcr.io/<owner>/cmms4fm-{api,frontend,nginx,mcp}:latest and :sha-<commit>
             → curls the Coolify deploy webhook
```

`docker-compose.yml` resolves `${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}`. To roll back, set `IMAGE_TAG` to a
`sha-<commit>` value in Coolify and redeploy — note the tag carries the **full** commit sha,
not the short one. Required repo secrets: `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`, `COOLIFY_API_TOKEN`.

**The builder image's Node version is coupled to Vite and nothing enforces it.** `vite@8`
declares `engines.node "^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0"`; the frontend Dockerfile was on `node:21.6.1`,
which satisfies neither, and the image build failed while every local build stayed green —
developers here run a much newer Node, and npm only *warns* on an engines mismatch instead of
refusing to install. So the mismatch is invisible until CI, and it looks like the application
broke rather than the toolchain. When bumping Vite, read `engines` and check the `FROM` line.

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the Maven suite and the `mcp/` suite as separate jobs, so a
test failure does not block an image build and a build failure stays distinguishable from a
test failure. It also runs on `pull_request`, which is the reason to route anything risky — an
upstream sync above all — through a branch and a PR: CI on JDK 17 is the authority for the
backend, and it has already caught a bad merge resolution that a local build called green.

**A deploy takes about 50 seconds** since the move to Vite; it used to be around five minutes.
If one suddenly takes minutes again, that is a signal worth following rather than waiting out.

**That number stopped holding on 2026-09-05, the day the `mcp` image joined the stack.** One
deploy took **23m37s** and succeeded; a second one, triggered through Coolify's API a minute
later, sat "In progress" for over forty minutes and blocked the queue behind it until it
cleared on its own. The whole domain answers `no available server` for the duration, which
reads like an outage and is a redeploy. A fourth image being pulled for the first time explains
seconds, not twenty minutes, so the cause is more likely something being *waited on* — see the
two red healthchecks under Open items. Not diagnosed; recorded so the next slow deploy is not
mistaken for a first occurrence.

### Coolify behaviour worth knowing

Each of these cost a failed deployment. They are not documented upstream.

- **Relative bind mounts do not use the git checkout.** Coolify rewrites `./foo` to
  `/data/coolify/applications/<uuid>/foo` and Docker creates a *directory* when the source
  file is missing — which then cannot mount onto a file. This is why the nginx config is
  baked into an image instead of mounted. Do not reintroduce file bind mounts.
  Directory mounts (`./logo`, `./config`) are fine.
- **`container_name` is ignored.** Containers are named `<service>-<resource-uuid>-<id>`.
  Scripts must resolve names via `docker ps`, never hardcode.
- **Empty environment values are not passed through as compose defaults.** Upstream relies
  on `${VAR:- }` producing a single space to keep optional keys truthy for
  `runtime-env-cra`; that space does not survive Coolify. `frontend/docker-entrypoint.sh`
  fills blanks before generating `runtime-env.js`. Do not remove it.
  Despite the name, `runtime-env-cra` survived the move off Create React App untouched: it
  only reads the key list from `.env` and writes `window.__RUNTIME_CONFIG__` into a JS file
  in the served directory, which has nothing to do with the bundler. `index.html` loads it
  with `defer` *before* the app's module script, and both being deferred means they run in
  document order — so the config is in place before the app reads it. Keep that order.
- **No host port publishing.** Coolify's proxy routes to the container; a `ports:` entry
  bypasses TLS and collides with other stacks on the host.
- **Domains are per service.** Set the domain on `nginx` only. Setting it on `frontend`
  as well creates two Traefik routers competing for the same host rule, and bypasses the
  `/api/` and `/storage/` routes entirely. `PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` must match the domain
  exactly — `https://`, no trailing slash. A mismatch shows up as a loading UI with a
  failing login, which reads like a backend fault but is configuration.

## Conventions

- `.gitattributes` pins `*.sh`, `Dockerfile`, `*.conf` and `.env.example` to **LF**.
  Development happens on Windows and these files run inside Linux containers; a CRLF
  shebang or a stray `\r` in a config value breaks the container at runtime, not at build
  time. When adding a shell script, verify it byte-wise, not just by eyeballing output —
  command substitution strips trailing whitespace and will hide the problem.
- Alpine images use `ash`. No `$'\r'`, no bashisms in entrypoints.
- Commit messages: what broke and why, not just what changed.

### Adding a list filter

List pages post a `SearchCriteria` to `/<entity>/search`; `SpecificationBuilder` joins every
`FilterField` with **AND**. Two things follow, and both have already produced filters that
silently return nothing:

- **Enums are stored as ordinals.** `2026_01_10_1768015926_enums_type.xml` converted those
  columns to `SMALLINT`, and `WrapperSpecification.getRealValue` converts an incoming string
  to an enum only for `PRIORITY`, `STATUS` and `JS_DATE`, and only in the `in` branch. A
  filter carrying `"IMAGE"` therefore compares a string against a number. A new enum filter
  needs an `EnumName` entry plus a `case` — i.e. an API change. Ordinal storage also means a
  new enum constant may only be appended, never inserted.
- **Controllers append their own filter fields.** `FileController.search` adds
  `hidden eq false`, and `createdBy eq <own id>` for users without the view-other
  permission. A client-side filter on the same field is ANDed with that one, so it can only
  ever narrow to nothing. Check the controller before offering a field in the UI.

Two more traps in the same area:

- **`query.distinct(true)` is not a safe fix for the duplicate rows** an `inm` (many-to-many)
  filter produces. Work orders sort by `asset.name`, `location.name`, `category.name` and
  `primaryUser.firstName`; Postgres rejects `SELECT DISTINCT` with an `ORDER BY` expression
  that is not in the select list, so the page 500s as soon as both are active. Use an
  IN-subquery on the root id instead of a join if this ever needs fixing.
- **`File`'s to-many sides are not all wired to the table that holds the data.**
  `File.assets` mirrors `Asset.files` onto `t_asset_file_associations` and works.
  `File.workOrders` originally mapped `T_WorkOrder_File_Associations`, but attachments live
  in `work_order_files` — the default name Hibernate derives because `WorkOrderBase.files`
  declares no `@JoinTable`. Both tables exist, so `ddl-auto: validate` passes and the wrong
  one simply stays empty. `File.parts`, `File.locations` and `File.Requests` have not been
  checked; `request_files` next to `t_request_file_associations` suggests the same split.

Search inputs are debounced with `useMemo(..., [])`, which freezes the closure. Read
`criteria` through a ref (`WorkOrders/index.tsx`, `Files/index.tsx`) — the `Parts.tsx`
version closes over `criteria` directly and only survives because that page has no other
filters.

## Security posture

Upstream targets a hosted multi-tenant product where public signup is a feature. For a
private single-tenant instance that default is wrong. Changes made here:

- **`UserService.signup` always requires an invitation** to join an existing organization.
  Upstream gated that check behind `enableInvitationViaEmail`, turning a mail-delivery
  setting into an authorization one: with mail off, a `POST /auth/signup` carrying
  `{"role":{"id":N}}` joined the organization owning role N *with that role*. Role ids are
  sequential and id 1 is the super-admin role, which is company-bound — so the most
  damaging path was also the cleanest one. `invite()` persists the invitation before it
  checks the mail flag, so invitations still work with mail disabled.
- **nginx returns 403** for `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/demo/generate-account`. This is
  now redundancy, not the primary control. To onboard someone, comment the signup line out
  for the duration — the backend holds the door on its own.
- `ALLOWED_ORGANIZATION_ADMINS` restricts who may create a *new* organization. Empty means
  anyone.

### "Wrong credentials" used to mean anything at all

For minutes after every deploy the login form claimed the password was wrong. Three layers
each turned "the api is not ready" into an authentication verdict, and all three are fixed —
if a login failure ever looks implausible again, re-check them in this order:

- nginx and the frontend are static and serve the login form within milliseconds. The api
  needs Liquibase, Hibernate and Quartz — tens of seconds. `depends_on` alone waits for the
  container to *start*, not to be *ready*, so the api could also outrun postgres. Postgres now
  has a `pg_isready` healthcheck the api waits on, and the api has one on
  `/actuator/health/readiness`.
- `UserService.signin` caught `AuthenticationException` and answered 403 "Invalid
  credentials". `InternalAuthenticationServiceException` extends it, and Spring wraps
  *anything* that fails while loading the user in it — including an unreachable database. It
  is now caught first and answers 503.
- `utils/api.ts` threw away the HTTP status, and `LoginJWT` mapped every rejection to
  `wrong_credentials`. The status now travels on `ApiError`; use `isServerUnavailable(err)`
  rather than assuming a failed call means the user got something wrong.

Healthcheck note: probe `/actuator/health/readiness`, never plain `/actuator/health`. The
aggregate includes the mail indicator, which defaults to on (`ENABLE_MAIL_HEALTH_CHECK`) and
reports DOWN without SMTP configured — a probe on it never turns green. The readiness group
is pinned to `readinessState,db` in `application.yml` for exactly this reason.

### Known upstream issue: the default super admin

`ApplicationInitializer` creates `superadmin@test.com` with the hardcoded password
`pls_change_me` on first start. Both values are in the public upstream source, and
`/auth/signin` is not covered by the nginx block — no exploit needed, just the login form.

**Status: mitigated in the database, not in code.** The account on the deployed instance is
disabled (`enabled = false`), which is the correct mitigation — `CustomUserDetail.isEnabled()`
is checked during authentication, so it cannot log in, and the account still exists so the
initializer leaves it alone. Replacing the password hash is a useful second lock. But the fix
lives in the data, not the source: **any environment that starts against a fresh or restored
pre-mitigation database is vulnerable again from the first boot**, silently and with no log
line saying so. Re-check after every restore, every new environment and every database reset:

```sql
SELECT id, email, enabled FROM users WHERE email = 'superadmin@test.com';
-- expected: enabled = false. If it is true, or the row is missing, act.
```

**Do not delete this account.** The recreation guard is not "does this email exist" but
`userService.findByCompany(<super-admin company>).isEmpty()` — the initializer recreates the
account with the default password whenever the super-admin role's company has no users at all.
Two consequences: deleting the account brings it straight back with `pls_change_me`, and if
another user happens to sit in that company, deleting it does *not* bring it back and the
instance is left with no super admin at all.

**The code-level fix is in.** `getSuperAdminSignupRequest` no longer hardcodes
`pls_change_me`; it generates a random password and logs it once at WARN. Logging it is
deliberate — without it a fresh instance has no way in at all — but it means the credential
appears in the boot log of the very first start and nowhere else. A fresh database is
therefore no longer reachable from the public source, and the instruction above still applies
to whoever reads that log: sign in once, change it, disable the account, do not delete it.

`dev-docs/SuperAdmin password update guide.md` describes signing in with the default password
in order to change it. That path does not work while the account is disabled, which is intended.

### Self-hosting premium unlock

Upstream gates API access (`x-api-key`), webhooks, workflows, CSV import and the usage
limits (assets, work orders, users, ...) behind two stacked checks: the company's
`SubscriptionPlan` features *and* a `LicenseEntitlement` that `LicenseService` validates
against `api.keygen.sh`. For a private single-tenant instance that is both a paywall
around AGPL source we already have and a hard dependency on a third party.

**Setting the variable in Coolify is not enough on its own, and the failure is silent.** The
`api` service in `docker-compose.yml` enumerates its environment explicitly, so a variable that
no `${...}` in that block references never reaches the container — the application falls back to
its own default and nothing in any log says why. `SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM`,
`AUTOMATION_ENABLED` and `TRIAGE_ENABLED` are listed there now; **any further switch has to be
added in both places**, the application's `application.yml` and that block.

`SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM=true` (default `false`) opens both gates without any outbound
call:

- `LicenseService.getLicensingState()` short-circuits to a fully-entitled state (every
  `LicenseEntitlement`, `usersCount = MAX`) — this covers `hasEntitlement(...)` and every
  `checkUsageBasedLimit(...)` across the services.
- `ApplicationInitializer` grants the **FREE** plan all `PlanFeatures` on boot. Every
  company defaults to FREE ([`SubscriptionService`](api/src/main/java/com/grash/service/SubscriptionService.java)),
  so this unlocks the plan-gated half of the checks instance-wide.

Both halves are required together — the `x-api-key` path checks license `AND` plan in
`ApiKeyAuthFilter` and `ApiKeyService.create`. The asset/work-order REST endpoints
themselves are **not** license-gated; only `ROLE_CLIENT` + the create permission. So a
plain JWT login (`/auth/signin`) can already create assets without this flag — the flag is
for the convenient long-lived API-key path and the rest of the premium surface.

Leave it `false` on any hosted/multi-tenant deployment; it removes the paywall the
upstream billing model relies on. **Caveat:** the FREE-plan change is persisted, so turning
the flag back off does not re-lock FREE — reset its feature set by hand if you need
upstream FREE behaviour again. When syncing upstream, re-check `LicenseService`,
`ApplicationInitializer` and `ApiKeyAuthFilter`, since our changes live there.

## Open items

- Make the nginx signup block toggleable via an environment variable (`envsubst` templates
  are supported by the nginx image) instead of editing the config.
- **The api healthcheck has never once been green.** It probes
  `/actuator/health/readiness`, but `WebSecurityConfig` does not permit that path, so
  Spring Security answers 403 and the probe fails from the first second of every container's
  life (`FailingStreak` in the thousands). Nothing depends on the check, so it gates nothing —
  which is exactly why it went unnoticed. The fix is one line in the permit list:
  `.requestMatchers("/actuator/health/readiness", "/actuator/health/liveness").permitAll()`.
  Worth doing: a signal that is permanently red trains everyone to ignore it, and on this
  codebase misleading health and error signals have already cost hours (see "Wrong
  credentials" above). It also already costs something: the `mcp` service cannot wait on
  `service_healthy` for the api and settles for `service_started`, retrying the OpenAPI
  document itself instead. And it is now a suspect in the slow deploys above — if Coolify
  waits for containers to report healthy, a check that is red by construction is the first
  place to look.
- **The `mcp` healthcheck is red by construction during a cold start.** Its `start-period` is
  60s ([`mcp/Dockerfile`](mcp/Dockerfile)), but the server deliberately does not listen until it
  has fetched the OpenAPI document, and that comes from the api, which needs up to 150s. So on a
  full-stack restart the container is legitimately unhealthy for minutes and a caller sees
  Traefik's `no available server` rather than a reason. Raising the grace period would hide it;
  the fix is to make readiness honest — listen immediately and answer `/healthz` with 503 plus
  the cause while the document is still loading. Then an orchestrator gets "not ready yet"
  instead of a refused connection. Design note in
  [`docs/mcp-server-konzept.md`](docs/mcp-server-konzept.md) §12.5.
- **One API key serves every MCP client.** The rule the design sets is one minimally permitted
  CMMS *user* per lasting client, because the profile only governs what a model can see while
  the key's user governs what it may do. Read-only use makes this cheap to defer; **switching
  any client to a writing profile without fixing it first is the mistake to avoid.**
- **`POST /work-orders/search` returns the whole company** for a user who has no work-order
  view permission at all. `WorkOrderService.getSearchCriteria` only ever narrows: it adds the
  company filter, then adds the own-records filter *inside* an `if (viewPermissions contains
  WORK_ORDERS)`, so lacking that permission means no narrowing rather than no access.
  Upstream behaviour, found while building the filtered export. `AssetService.getSearchCriteria`
  gets this right (it throws), which is the shape the fix should take. Reporting-specific
  detail in [`docs/reporting.md`](docs/reporting.md#5-stage-1--filtered-export).

## Upstream

`dev-docs/` holds upstream documentation (TLS, LDAP, disabling users, running SQL,
backups). It describes the upstream deployment model, not ours — treat compose snippets
there as illustrative.

**The upstream repository was renamed** from `Grashjs/atlas-cmms` to `Grashjs/cmms`; the old
path 404s. The remote is configured as `upstream`, so `git fetch upstream` works.

### Keeping in step with upstream

**Upstream is alive and fast: roughly eleven commits a day.** In the three weeks between the
fork (2026-08-02) and the first sync (2026-08-26) it produced 264 of them. This is drift, not
a backlog that sits still, so the interval is the whole game — the work per sync grows faster
than the time between them, because changes start landing on top of each other.

**Sync monthly, or before starting anything larger.** The routine, cheapest first:

1. **Try GitHub's "Sync fork" button** on the repository page. It only handles the trivial
   case and refuses when there are conflicts — but when it works there is nothing else to do.
   The more often you sync, the more often it is enough.
2. **Otherwise do it locally**, on a branch, with a pull request:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b chore/upstream-sync main
   git merge upstream/main        # resolve, then push and open a PR against main
   ```
   The branch-and-PR detour is not ceremony: CI on JDK 17 is what catches a bad resolution,
   and it caught one on the first sync.
3. **Merge the PR with "Create a merge commit".** Never squash and never rebase a sync — that
   discards the merge base, and the next `git merge upstream/main` will present all of
   upstream's commits again, conflicts and all, against code you already have.

**What the first sync actually cost, as a calibration point:** 264 commits, of which 394 files
merged cleanly and 25 needed a decision. One real mistake got through to CI (see
`AssetServiceTest` in the table below). Roughly a working afternoon, most of it diagnosis
rather than merging.

**The recurring shape is "both, not either".** Upstream adds something next to a place this
fork already changed, and the answer is usually to keep both rather than pick a winner — their
refresh-token return value *and* our 503 handling, their sanitisation *and* our category
binding. Reflexively taking one side is how a fix gets silently dropped.

**Where upstream had already solved our problem, take theirs.** It happened three times on the
first sync, and each time adopting their version shrank the divergence permanently. The one
exception worth stating: the frontend `CMD`. Upstream inlines `runtime-env-cra && nginx`, which
is exactly what crash-loops behind Coolify — `docker-entrypoint.sh` has to stay.

**Upstream modernises the backend and not the frontend.** That asymmetry decides what is worth
doing here. Backend dependency currency arrives for free by syncing: the first sync brought
Liquibase 5, Thymeleaf 6, JWT 0.13 and google-cloud-storage 2.64, and dropped `firebase`,
`axios` and `jsonwebtoken` from the frontend, which cleared one critical and six high findings
without a single risky upgrade. Their frontend, meanwhile, has not moved: still React 17.0.2,
MUI 5.8.2, TypeScript 4.7.3 and `react-scripts`.

**So think twice before moving further ahead of them there.** This fork is already off CRA and
on TypeScript 5.9, and that divergence is small and paid for. React 18/19 or a MUI major would
be neither: upstream is active in `frontend/`, and every future sync would land on code written
against React 17 and MUI 5. For an instance whose purpose is finding out which features matter,
having upstream's features is worth more than having React 19.

**Keeping own changes cheap.** A file only this fork has can never conflict. Where a change can
live in a new file rather than inside an upstream one, that is worth a little awkwardness — it
is the difference between paying for it once and paying at every sync.

When syncing upstream changes, re-check the files we have diverged in. This list is what a
merge has to walk, so keep it accurate — a wrong entry wastes time, a missing one gets a
fix silently overwritten:

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Signup hardening | `UserService.signup` |
| Default super admin password | `ApplicationInitializer.getSuperAdminSignupRequest` |
| Premium unlock | `LicenseService`, `ApplicationInitializer`, `application.yml` |
| Category-bound custom fields | `CustomField`, `CustomFieldService`, `CustomFieldValueService`, `CustomFieldRepository`, `AssetService.setAssetCustomFields`. **Also `AssetServiceTest`**: `AssetService` calls the *seven*-argument `setCustomFields` because it passes the category id, while upstream's tests stub the six-argument overload. Mockito's strict stubs then reject the call and the surrounding verifies fail with it. When upstream touches that test, re-add the seventh `any()` — the test is right about their code and wrong about ours |
| Vendor/customer custom fields | `Settings/Features/Contractors/CustomFields.tsx` and `Settings/Features/Vendors/CustomFields.tsx` pass the `CustomFieldEntityType` **the other way round from upstream**, which has the two swapped: fields created under the customers tile were stored as `VENDOR` and appeared on vendors. The forms (`VendorsAndCustomers/Customers.tsx`, `Vendors.tsx`) are the authority on which type belongs where. A sync that touches these one-line files will look like a trivial take-theirs and reintroduce the bug |
| Category description in `CategoryMiniDTO` | `CategoryMiniDTO` carries `description`, and the asset detail view plus the category select render it. Upstream's mini DTO is id and name only; a sync taking theirs makes the field vanish from every category dropdown without breaking anything visibly |
| Error handling in auth | `UserService.signin` and `LdapService.signinLdap` each keep a `catch (InternalAuthenticationServiceException)` returning 503 **in front of** the `AuthenticationException` catch. Upstream returns a refresh-token pair from the same method, so a sync usually conflicts here — the answer is both, their return plus our catch |
| Work order → purchase order | `PurchaseOrder`, `PurchaseOrderService`, `PurchaseOrderController`, `PurchaseOrderRepository` |
| Light sidebar | `layouts/ExtendedSidebarLayout/Sidebar/**`, `theme/schemes/*.ts` |
| Sidebar order and labels | `Sidebar/SidebarMenu/items.ts` (order, no two-child dropdowns, `activePath`), `SidebarMenu/index.tsx`, `i18n/translations/de.ts` |
| Branding | `components/LogoSign` (caption under the mark), `public/favicon*`, `public/static/images/logo/**`, `frontend/scripts/build-logo-assets.ps1`, `docs/logo_v3.png`, `docs/fav_fm_v2..png` |
| Reporting: column registry | `CsvFileGenerator` (work-order and asset writers now delegate), `utils/csv/**`, `CsvFileGeneratorTest` (constructs the generator instead of `@InjectMocks`) |
| Reporting: filtered export | `ExportController`, `AsyncExportService`, `WorkOrderService.findForExport`, `AssetService.findForExport` |
| Reporting: shared asset scoping | `AssetService.getSearchCriteria` (extracted out of `AssetController.search`) |
| Reporting: export headers | `messages.properties`, `messages_de_DE.properties` (appended keys) |
| Saved views | `SavedView*` (new files), `frontend` work-order and asset list pages, `hooks/useTableState.ts`, `hooks/useExport.ts` |
| Request triage | Almost all new files (`service/triage/**`, `event/**`, `RequestQualification*`, `AssetTriageRepository`, `frontend` `QualificationCard.tsx` + `slices/requestQualification.ts`), so a sync should not touch them. The exceptions are the ones to watch: **`RequestController`** carries one added line at the end of `onRequestCreation` — the published `RequestCreatedEvent` — and upstream edits that method; and `RequestDetails.tsx` renders `<QualificationCard>` above the approve buttons. `AssetRepository` is deliberately *not* involved: the triage query lives in its own repository interface so it cannot conflict |
| Rule automation (new engine) | `api/.../automation/**` and the `frontend` `Settings/Features/Automation/**`, `slices/automation.ts`, `models/owns/automation.ts` are all new, so a sync cannot touch them. Two edited files matter. **`AssetService`**: our earlier `EntityChangedEvent` publish in `dispatchAssetStatusChangeWebhook` is **gone again** — field changes now come from Hibernate, and publishing there too would run every rule twice; if a sync reintroduces it, delete it rather than merging it. `application.yml` carries the `automation.*` keys. On the frontend `router/app.tsx`, `Settings/Features/index.tsx`, `store/rootReducer.ts` plus the appended `en.ts`/`de.ts` keys each hold one added line or block. The one thing to re-check after a Hibernate or Spring upgrade is `automation/capture/ChangeListenerRegistrar`, which unwraps `SessionFactoryImpl` and calls `requireService(EventListenerRegistry)` — an API that has moved between Hibernate majors before. It runs in `@PostConstruct`, so a break fails the whole context and every integration test with it, which is the right way round |
| File search and filters | `content/own/Files/index.tsx`, `content/own/Files/Filters/**` |
| File→asset/work-order links | `File` (`workOrders` join table), `FileShowDTO`, `FileMapper` |
| Build tooling (frontend) | **Upstream is still Create React App; this fork is not.** `frontend/vite.config.ts` (new), `frontend/index.html` (moved out of `public/`), `frontend/package.json` scripts, `src/config.ts` + `src/serviceWorker.ts` (`import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`), `src/vite-env.d.ts`. Deleted here: `config-overrides.js`, `src/react-app-env.d.ts`. An upstream change touching the build, `public/index.html` or `REACT_APP_*` needs translating, not merging |
| Container plumbing | frontend `Dockerfile` + `docker-entrypoint.sh`, `docker/nginx/**`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| MCP server | `mcp/**` is entirely new, so a sync cannot touch it. What it *reads* can change under it, and that is what to re-check: `springdoc` settings in `application.yml` (the document's group URL — `SPEC_GROUP` defaults to `atlas-cmms`), `ApiKeyAuthFilter` (the auth path it relies on), and the endpoints its curated tools name. A renamed or removed endpoint from the curated table fails `mcp/test/catalog.test.ts` rather than failing silently at runtime — refresh `mcp/test/fixtures/api-docs.json` from the running instance after a sync and run `npm test` in `mcp/` |

`ApiKeyAuthFilter` is **not** in that list. It reads the license and plan gates that
`SELF_HOSTED_UNLOCK_PREMIUM` opens, so it is worth reading to understand the unlock — but
it is untouched upstream code and needs no merge attention.
